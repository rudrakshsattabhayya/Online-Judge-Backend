Given an array 𝑎
 of length 𝑛
, containing integers. And there are two initially empty arrays 𝑏
 and 𝑐
. You need to add each element of array 𝑎
 to exactly one of the arrays 𝑏
 or 𝑐
, in order to satisfy the following conditions:

Both arrays 𝑏
 and 𝑐
 are non-empty. More formally, let 𝑙𝑏
 be the length of array 𝑏
, and 𝑙𝑐
 be the length of array 𝑐
. Then 𝑙𝑏,𝑙𝑐≥1
.
For any two indices 𝑖
 and 𝑗
 (1≤𝑖≤𝑙𝑏,1≤𝑗≤𝑙𝑐
), 𝑐𝑗
 is not a divisor of 𝑏𝑖
.
Output the arrays 𝑏
 and 𝑐
 that can be obtained, or output −1
 if they do not exist.
