Given an array 𝑎 of length 𝑛, containing integers. And there are two initially empty arrays 𝑏 and 𝑐. You need to add each element of array 𝑎
 to exactly one of the arrays 𝑏 or 𝑐, in order to satisfy the following conditions:

-> Both arrays 𝑏 and 𝑐 are non-empty. More formally, let 𝑙𝑏 be the length of array 𝑏, and 𝑙𝑐 be the length of array 𝑐. Then 𝑙𝑏,𝑙𝑐≥1.
-> For any two indices 𝑖 and 𝑗 (1≤𝑖≤𝑙𝑏,1≤𝑗≤𝑙𝑐), 𝑐𝑗 is not a divisor of 𝑏𝑖.

Output the arrays 𝑏 and 𝑐 that can be obtained, or output −1 if they do not exist.

Input 
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤100 ) — the length of array 𝑎 .

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤109 ) — the elements of array 𝑎 .

Output 
For each test case, output a single integer −1 if a solution does not exist. 

Otherwise, in the first line, output two integers 𝑙𝑏 and 𝑙𝑐 — the lengths of arrays 𝑏 and 𝑐 respectively. 

In the second line, output 𝑙𝑏 integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑙𝑏 — the elements of array 𝑏. 

In the third line, output 𝑙𝑐 integers 𝑐1,𝑐2,…,𝑐𝑙𝑐 — the elements of array 𝑐. 

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. You can output the elements of the arrays in any order.
